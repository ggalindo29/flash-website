## Typography
- I picked these typefaces, Proxima Nova and EB Garamond, because they pair well (according to typewolf.com) portay mood of fun and playful as well as business which is why I think it would be perfect for this website. This website's purpose is to introduce the three team members which tends to be a more professional setting.

## Readability
- The prior font was similar to the typeface Papyrus which tends to be much more curvy and tight in terms of spacing which tends to infringe on the readability of the content. Proxima Nova is very popular due to it's geometric style as well as it's increase in spacing. EB Garamond is also a very clean font that allows for more spacing and therefore an increase in readability.
- I increased the line spacing and font size in their aside section to allow for more white space for improved readability.
- I also increased the line spacing in the p tags to allow for easier reading since there is so much content in these sections, it allows for more whitespace between lines and therefore increased readability.
